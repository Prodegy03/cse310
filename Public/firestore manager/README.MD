# Overview

This Software is ment to colaborate with google Firebase in order to catolog movies in a personal database. The personal database needs to have a json file with all of the media info (author, title, actors, discription, rating). This software will insert, update, and read data stored on firebase firestore, and the json file. The purpose is to keep firestore acurate.

    In order to use this software update the json file with the information from your media library and run the main.py.

    My purpose in writing this program is to keep an updated database of my family media information.
